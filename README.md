# Description

Alina Tudor Portfolio was a lovely project where I come up with a design for my portfolio, recreating this with bootstrap.

A high-quality portfolio can attract hiring managers to your website and nudge them to get to know you, your brand of design, and what you can contribute. An excellent front-end web dev portfolio can get you noticed by employers, irrespective of your career stage. This process takes work, but the benefits are worth it.

# Challenges

Using bootstrap was easier than creating a website from scratch with flex and grid, however to overwrite the bootstrap CSS was acutally a big challenge.

I have worked with the Chrome developer tool a lot and I've managed to overwrite the bootstrap code to create my desired design, also slowly Google search becomes my BFF. God bless the devs community!

# Things I learned

Getting this challenge done, I've become more aware of the information we can find on Google if we look deep. How to overwrite the Bootstrap code becomes easier now and console is my firned.
